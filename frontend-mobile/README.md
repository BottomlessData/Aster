This directory contains a simple [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app with the [Expo](https://expo.io/) development framework.

If errors:
Invariant Violation: Tried to register two views with the same name RNCSafeAreaProvider
Invariant Violation: "main" has not been registered.

Fix: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64931250/invariant-violation-tried-to-register-two-views-with-the-same-name-rncsafeareap
open your app route folder ==> node_modules ==> invariant ==> browser.js
in browser.js file remove the [if condition code] (line number 28 to 46 )
